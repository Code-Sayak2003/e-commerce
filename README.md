<h1>E-commerce</h1>
<br>
<p>This is a clothing e-commerce application created using react. For state management I have used zustand. For displaying errors and successes, I have used react-hot-toast. It allows you to select clothes from a 
 collection of men's and women's apparels. You can add items to your cart and checkout at once.</p>
